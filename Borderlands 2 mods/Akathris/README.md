-Kitty

A pretty ok gun for my first try
I do plan on fixing and balancing it


-American Patriot

It's an alright skin but @Yurot made a better one lol


-M392 DMR

This is supposed to resemble the gun of the same name from Halo
Yes it's an assault rifle don't reeee me for it
I also plan on balancing this too


-Sal the Invincible

Makes Sal Invincible ![](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/64138/3.0)



-No More Moxxi Lifesteal

Pretty self explanatory, removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regen
Keep in mind that not much testing has gone into this yet and it is in no way balanced fully
There are some stat, name, and red text changes but you can pick and chose what you want in Filter Tool



-Another Hecking Sal Mod

This one actually does something lol, has options for less Sal screms (Thanks to Mike/soze)
Can also toggle Gunzerk if ya wanna
And has health regen and lifesteal options



-DorkHeck = loser
Self explanatory, makes DorkHeck a confirmed loser lul
Just some friendly banter dont reeee me
