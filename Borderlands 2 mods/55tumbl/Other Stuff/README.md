## Overview

**`fixUCPerrors.blcm`**
This small mod fixes the few "overwrite" errors (the ones that appear in orange in the UCP when using BLCMM 1.1.6 in developer mode). 
More precisely, it makes the buffs to C0unter Strike and the Crit, which had so far no effect at all, work as intended.
Same for the Pot'o'Gold (although the money drops still don't scale, but that's another issue).
These fixes will probably be included in UCP 4.1.1, but in the meantime you can just import `fixUCPerrors.blcm` as a single mod.
