### Ammo Mod 1.0 by Lollo
This is a simple mod that allows you change the amount of ammo you get from each ammo pickup. 
Each ammo type has several options for the amount you want to receive: x1 (default), x1.5, x2, and Ludicrous.

Thanks to a bunch of the modders around here for being around to help me make my first mod.

Bit of a warning, if you use any of the Combat Rifle options it will either overwrite the UCP change to rifle ammo
or it will be overwritten by the UCP.

Feel free to change this code however you like but please, DO NOT REHOST IT
