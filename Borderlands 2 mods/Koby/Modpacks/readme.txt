Koby's mods (including BL2 Reborn) have been discontinued.  Individual mods
may reappear at Nexus or here at some point, but in the meantime DO NOT
come into Shadow's Discord (or any other place, really) asking where the
mods are, or where you can get the files, or even why they've been
discontinued.  You will have to content yourself with just Not Using These
Mods.
