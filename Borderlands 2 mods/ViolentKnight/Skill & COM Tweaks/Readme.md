This mod upgrades all legendary and slayer of terramorphous COMs so that they are all on par with each other. Each COM was carefully designed and optimized to cater to a certain build or play style that is expressed on that class' skills. For some classes, I felt that 5 COMs were not enough to appropriately encompass their build diversity, so I made an additional COM. 

In some cases, skill trees were changed to make them easier to build/dip into, or to favor trees that were generally seen as unattractive beyond a certain point. The goal here is to bring more diversity to the table by exploring all of the main ways each class can be played, within reason. The COMs were balanced for and playtested in OP8, but should be fine at any level.

There should be no 'bad' COMs anymore. If anything, they are a little on the OP side, but the concept of OP is highly debatable in a world where Salvador and things like Grog Nozzle exist simultaneously (not to mention certain exploits). Note that most COMs' manufacturers haven't been changed, because that's kind of a pain to do.
