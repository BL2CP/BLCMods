1. I've forgetten the exact sequences I wrote. Maybe some successive AOEs, unexpected attack sequences, high bullet speed, high DOT chance, mixed projectiles and a better engine, but I do reserve some time window. So good luck.
2. AOE could be avoided by jumping at proper timing but it's hard.
3. GD_Balance_HealthAndDamage.AIParameters.Attribute_HealthMultiplier determines health. Current value is 1000.000000, change it if you want.
