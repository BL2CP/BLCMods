0. Thanks to all modders in BLCMods. Without learning your wiki and mods like UCP/Reborn/FFYLland2 I won't be able to do this. This mod start at about 2018.3 and now is version 2.0.

1. Modify some class mods' skin.
2. Modify most class mods.
3. For SMGs, Pistols and ARs, their DOT damage increased with gun rarity, at the same time differs between manufacturers.
4. Unique weapons which has fixed elemental type like Seraphim, Teapot and Twister have increased DOT damage and chance. For every elemental type, there are some top-tier weapons used for DOTs.
5. Skill tree modification. Modify some skills and introduce several new skills.
	5.1 Motion tree is now for DOT, based on a stack skill called Elemental resonance.
	5.2 Harmony tree is now for survival and support. Prevent from using Grog Nozzle after investing 20 points in this tree.
	5.3 Cataclysm tree is now for pure gun damage.
	5.4 There are connections between skills in different trees.
6. When use with other mods, use filtertool or BLCMM to disable all Maya skill changes/Maya class mod changes/smg ar pistol changes/some unique weapons changes(see changelog) in other mods to prevent from possible conflicts.
7. This mod doesn't include original Transient.SparkServiceConfiguration_6 hotfixes.

See details in Changelog.
