LootDespawner.loot
------------------

This mod is fairly simple, it just changes the amount of time it takes for all loot to shrink and despawn from the game.

This can prevent crashes upon traveling, non-functioning inventories, excessive lag, etcetera.
Does not conflict with mods that change item rarity colors (should be loaded last in Filter Tool to prevent despawn time overrides).
Does not delete any quest items, so it should be safe for any playthrough (please let me know if it does).
Various options for times, I'd personally use Recommended for standard gameplay.
If using mods such as Loot Splosion, Cold Dead Hands, or anything that causes excessive loot, I'd use the 1 minute despawn time.

JackU.spawn

Replaces the Tiny Tina New U station dialogue with that of Jack (specifically for this purpose with unused dialogue).  Currently trying to get it to work in the base game.

Teleport.txt
-------------
Adds binds that make use of Control, Alt, and Shift plus a letter or a number to teleport to certain locations.  
Most of the locations are raid boss related.
Can teleport everyone out of the map and kill you all if you mess up.
Teleports the whole lobby there for quick movement, faster farming and less time wasted.
General use: Control is the main location, Alt is always a fast travel station or exit, Shift is for an extra spot that is needed.
