*This compilation has been balanced with BL2Reborn and Level1UVHM in mind.* Download both at [Koby's Github.](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Koby)

To install:</br>
Simply add this mod to the bottom of BL2Reborn and Level1UVHM and save it.



**Changes from BL2Reborn and UVHM:**<br/>
-*(Hopefully) Increased drop rate of ammo from killed enemies.*<br/>
-*The increase to weapon swap speed introduced in UVHM has been removed due to the changes made to Slag.*<br/>
-*UCP elemental DoT buff has been removed (150% -> 0%).*<br/>
-*Enemies are much more resilient.*<br/>
-*Enemies no longer regenerate health.*<br/>
-*Slag no longer amplifies damage taken.*<br/>
-*Slag base duration is 5 seconds, down from 8.*<br/>
-*Slag is naturally weak towards everything (damage: 0.75). Application chance is the same across the board, however.*<br/>
-*Slag lowers movement speed by 90%.*<br/>
-*Slag lowers rate of fire by 50%.*
