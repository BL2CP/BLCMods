A test I made to replace "Arid Nexus Boneyard/Badlands Ambient" with "Cluster 00773 P4ND0R4 Ambient"
and "Arid Nexus Boneyard/Badlands Battle" with "Cluster 00773 P4ND0R4 Battle".

Backup your "Audio_Streaming.pck" first if you want to try.
I don't know why the "Cluster 00773 P4ND0R4 Ambient" works great in Ravioli Game Tools but cut in the game.
