Consistent & Mitigated Element Influence on Damage
--------------------------------------------------

This edit was created by Stygian Emperor based on the original mod, "No Elemental Penalties," by CZ47.
This reduces elemental penalties & bonuses vs, health, armor, and shields, but does not remove them entirely. It primarily brings TVHM and Mayhem mode in-line with playthrough 1, but shifts the balance subtly to generally make corrosive more useful throughout the game.

I made this because I did not enjoy swapping weapons constantly against every single non-boss enemy in Mayhem.

Elemental Damage Chart
----------------------

The elemental damage values of the *unmodded* game can be found here: https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_damage#Borderlands_3
The following is a chart showing the values in *this mod* (in all playthroughs and Mayhem levels):

|            | FLESH | SHIELD | ARMOR |
|   :---:    |   ---:|    ---:|   ---:|
| NONE       | 100%  | 100%   |  85%  |
| INCENDIARY | 150%  |  80%   |  75%  |
| SHOCK      |  80%  |  150%  |  75%  |
| CORROSIVE  |  80%  |   80%  | 150%  |
| CRYOGENIC  | 100%  |   80%  | 120%  |
| RADIATION  | 100%  |  120%  |  75%  |

However, the .bl3hotfix file can be edited in a text editor such as Notepad++ to easily alter the influence of elemental damage to your own liking.
