Consistent & Mitigated Element Influence on Damage
--------------------------------------------------

Based on the original mod, "No Elemental Penalties," by CZ47.
This reduces elemental penalties & bonuses vs, health, armor, and shields, but does not remove them entirely. It primarily brings TVHM and Mayhem mode in-line with playthrough 1, but shifts the balance subtly to generally make corrosive more useful throughout the game.

I made this because I did not enjoy swapping weapons constantly against every single non-boss enemy in Mayhem.

However, the .bl3hotfix file can be edited in a text editor such as Notepad++ to easily alter the influence of elemental damage to your own liking.
