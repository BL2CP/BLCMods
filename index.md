# Hello Vault Hunter!

This repository is for the people at [Shadow's Evil Hideout](https://discord.gg/0YjZxbVBS9b3bXUS)  
Home of the [BL2 Unofficial Community Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e68MFnAuIPQ) and
[TPS Unofficial Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch/Community%20Patch%202.1/Patch%202.1%20BLCMM).

[BLCMM](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Borderlands-Community-Mod-Manager) is the recommended
tool for managing (and creating) Borderlands 2/TPS mods, and can take care of all the steps
necessary for you to start running mods on your own.  (The previous tool, FilterTool, is no longer
supported, and has been replaced by BLCMM.)

A [Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) has been established! Share and gain modding knowledge

We are now on the [GBX Forums](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/unofficial-community-patch-thread/1557735)! 
However please only talk about Shadow's Patch and not any custom patches
