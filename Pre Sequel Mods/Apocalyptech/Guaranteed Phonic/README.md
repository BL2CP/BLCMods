Guaranteed Phonic
=================

**NOTE:** This mod is now included as an optional selection in TPS UCP 2.2's
"Optionals" category, so if you're using TPS UCP 2.2 or higher, there's no
longer any need to use this mod directly!  (It won't hurt anything to have
both enabled, though.)

This is a super simple mod which just guarantees the spawn of Phonic Kraggon
(or Phuper Phonic Kraggon) in Serenity's Waste.  Not much to say about it
otherwise!

Usage
=====

This mod must be imported into BLCMM with `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `Guaranteed Phonic.blcm` and have at it!
