# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BL2CP/BLCMods/wiki)

## Contribution

If you are not part of BL2CP, to contribute a mod:
- `Fork` the repository (top right).
- `Commit` files to the respective folders. (either `Borderlands 2 mods` or `Pre Sequel Mods`)
- Send a `Pull Request` to `Compare` merge your fork to the `master` branch.

If you are part of [BL2CP](https://github.com/BL2CP) you do not need to fork or pull request.

## Installation

To download the files click the green `Clone or Download` button in the top right.

Installing these files follows the same process as for the BL2 Community Patch using the [Patcher](https://github.com/AnotherBugworm/Borderlands2Patcher)

## Requirements

These mods can only be installed on PC and will never be ported to consoles due to technical and legal limitations.    
All non-headhunter DLC is required for the patch and likely most mods.
